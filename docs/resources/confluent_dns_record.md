## Import

You can import a DNS Record by using Environment ID and DNS Record ID, in the format `<Environment ID>/<DNS Record ID>`. The following example shows how to import a DNS Record:

```shell
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY="<cloud_api_key>"
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET="<cloud_api_secret>"
$ terraform import confluent_dns_record.main env-abc123/dnsrec-abc123
```
